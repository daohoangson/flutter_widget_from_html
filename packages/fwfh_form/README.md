WidgetFactory extension to render basic HTML forms.
This is a companion add-on for [flutter_widget_from_html_core](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_widget_from_html_core) package.

## Getting Started

Add this to your app's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_widget_from_html_core: any
  fwfh_form: ^0.16.0
```

## Usage

Then use `HtmlWidget` with a custom factory:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_widget_from_html_core/flutter_widget_from_html_core.dart';
import 'package:fwfh_form/fwfh_form.dart';

// ...

HtmlWidget(
  html,
  factoryBuilder: () => MyWidgetFactory(),
)

// ...

class MyWidgetFactory extends WidgetFactory with FormFactory {}
```
