# Copilot Session 002: Modernizing Just Audio Mock Platform

## Session Overview
This session focused on refactoring the test mock implementation for the fwfh_just_audio package to use the modern `Fake` pattern from test_api, aligning with the patterns used in other packages within the workspace.

## Problem Statement
The existing `audio_player_test.dart` file was directly extending `JustAudioPlatform` and `AudioPlayerPlatform` classes to create mock implementations. This approach was outdated compared to the newer `Fake` mechanism used in other packages like `fwfh_chewie` and `fwfh_webview`.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Created `mock_just_audio_platform.dart`
- **Location**: `./packages/fwfh_just_audio/test/mock_just_audio_platform.dart`
- **Pattern**: Used `Fake` with `MockPlatformInterfaceMixin` following the same pattern as:
  - `./packages/fwfh_chewie/test/mock_video_player_platform.dart`
  - `./packages/fwfh_webview/test/mock_webview_platform.dart`

**Key features of the new mock**:
```dart
class _FakeJustAudioPlatform extends Fake
    with MockPlatformInterfaceMixin
    implements JustAudioPlatform

class _FakeAudioPlayerPlatform extends Fake implements AudioPlayerPlatform
```

- Exported global variables for test state management:
  - `commands` - tracks platform method calls
  - `duration` - configurable audio duration
  - `playbackEvents` - stream controller for playback events

- Provided setup/teardown functions:
  - `mockJustAudioPlatform()` - initializes the mock platform
  - `initializeMockPlatform()` - resets state for each test
  - `disposeMockPlatform()` - cleans up resources

### 2. Updated `audio_player_test.dart`
- **Removed**: Direct class extensions (`_JustAudioPlatform`, `_AudioPlayerPlatform`)
- **Removed**: Private variables (`_commands`, `_duration`, `_playbackEvents`)
- **Added**: Import for the new mock platform
- **Updated**: All test code to use public exports from mock platform
- **Fixed**: `CommandType` enum usage (made public instead of private `_CommandType`)

### 3. Critical Bug Fixes
- **Added missing `playerDataMessageStream`**: The newer just_audio version requires this stream property
- **Maintained command tracking**: All platform method calls are properly tracked for test assertions
- **Preserved test behavior**: All existing tests continue to pass with identical behavior

## Technical Details

### Mock Platform Implementation
The mock implements all required platform interface methods:
- `load()` - tracks load commands and simulates loading/ready states
- `play()`, `pause()` - tracks playback commands
- `setVolume()` - tracks volume changes
- `seek()` - tracks seek operations
- Plus all other required platform methods with no-op implementations

### Stream Management
- `playbackEventMessageStream` - provides playback state events
- `playerDataMessageStream` - required by newer just_audio versions (returns empty stream)

### Command Tracking
Uses `Tuple2<CommandType, dynamic>` to track:
- `CommandType.load` - audio loading operations
- `CommandType.play` - play commands
- `CommandType.pause` - pause commands
- `CommandType.setVolume` - volume changes
- `CommandType.seek` - seek operations

## Benefits of the Refactor

1. **Consistency**: Now follows the same mock pattern as other packages in the workspace
2. **Maintainability**: Cleaner separation of concerns with dedicated mock file
3. **Modern Approach**: Uses `Fake` pattern instead of direct class extension
4. **Better Testing**: Proper `MockPlatformInterfaceMixin` integration
5. **Future-Proof**: Easier to extend and maintain as platform interfaces evolve

## Test Results
All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ plays then pauses on completion
- ✅ shows remaining (narrow)
- ✅ shows position & duration (wide)
- ✅ seeks
- ✅ mute functionality tests
- ✅ screenshot/golden tests

## Files Modified
1. **Created**: `./packages/fwfh_just_audio/test/mock_just_audio_platform.dart`
2. **Modified**: `./packages/fwfh_just_audio/test/audio_player_test.dart`

## Lessons Learned
- The `playerDataMessageStream` is a newer requirement in just_audio platform interface
- Command execution order can vary between different platform implementations
- Using `Fake` with `MockPlatformInterfaceMixin` provides better mock behavior than direct extension
- Global state management in test mocks requires careful setup/teardown handling

## Next Steps
This refactor provides a solid foundation for:
- Adding new test cases
- Updating to newer just_audio versions
- Maintaining consistency across the workspace's test patterns
